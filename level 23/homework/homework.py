## homework 2: Basic List Operations

#1. Create a list named fruits that contains the following items: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", and "elderberry".
#        Fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
#2. Print the entire list.
#           print(Fruits)
#3. Access and print the first and last items in the list.



#4. Add a new fruit "fig" to the list.
#       Fruits.append("fig")
#5. Remove "banana" from the list.
#       Fruits.remove("banana")
#           print(Fruits)
#6. Change the value of the second item to "blueberry".
#       Fruits[1] = "blueberry"
#            print(Fruits)
#7. Print the length of the list.
#            print(len(Fruits))

# homework 3: List Functions and Methods

#1. Create a list named numbers that contains the following integers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.

#    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

#2. Use the append() function to add the number 100 to the end of the list.
#   umbers.append(100)
#     print(numbers)
#3. Use the insert() function to add the number 5 at the beginning of the list.
#   numbers.insert(0, 5)
#     print(numbers)
#4. Use the remove() function to remove the number 30 from the list.
#   numbers.remove(30)
#     print(numbers)
#5. Use the sort() function to sort the list in ascending order.
#   numbers.sort() # ?
#6. Use the reverse() function to reverse the order of the list.
#   numbers.reverse() 
#     print(numbers)
#7. Use the index() function to find the index of the number 50.
#   numbers.index(50)
#     print(numbers)
#8. Use the count() function to count how many times 20 appears in the list.
#   numbers.count(20)
#     print(numbers)

# homework 4: Slicing and List Comprehensions

#1. Create a list named numbers that contains the integers from 1 to 10.
#   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#2. Use list slicing to create a new list named first_half that contains the first five elements from numbers.
#   first_half = numbers.list(0, 5)
#     print(first_half)
# ???
#3. Use list slicing to create another list named second_half that contains the last five elements from numbers.
#   second_half = numbers.list(5, -1)
#     print(second_half)
# ???
#4. Use a list comprehension to create a new list named squares that contains the squares of each 

#5. number in the numbers list.

#6. Print all three lists: first_half, second_half, and squares.
